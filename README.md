# Bajaj-Dataset
A scalable and accurate FastAPI service that processes lab report images to extract structured medical test data. The solution uses traditional OCR and parsing techniques (no LLMs) to identify test names, values, reference ranges, and units, while automatically calculating if values fall outside normal ranges.
